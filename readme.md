Forked from [NTProductions](https://github.com/NTProductions/export-artboards-to-files).

Meant for automated use in Enfocus Switch with the [Illustrator Configurator/App](https://www.enfocus.com/en/appstore/product/adobe-illustrator).
Set the "command" property to "use script" and set the path to the jsx file.

Note: Currently this script is for Mac only. Windows integration has a permissions issue with files being pulled from the os temp directory.
